# Focatron

This project was made as part of my Backend Programming course with the Laravel framework.

## Description
The project is a simplified version of the Flaschore app, focusing on soccer championships. It provides features such as a scoreboard, information on upcoming and past matches, and dedicated team pages. 
Users can mark specific teams as favorites and track them separately.
Administrators have additional privileges, including adding or removing teams, matches, players, and events. They can also close ongoing matches.

## Demo
A working demo is available at https://vps.axtrone.hu/
